It's Simple
-----------

`mkdir -p path/to/dir`
`git clone https://github.com/andrew-werdna/DockerMeanSetup.git path/to/dir/docker`
`docker-compose up --build -d`

The path/to/your/directory is a convenient container for your whole setup.
The path/to/your/directory/docker is where this repo will live.
When you up the containers, your folders mount folders will be created inside
path/to/dir
